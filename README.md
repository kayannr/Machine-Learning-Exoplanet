# Machine Learning Homework - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset are created. The following tasks are completed: 

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
* Preprocess the dataset prior to fitting the model.
* Perform feature selection and remove unnecessary features.
* Use `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separate the data into training and testing data.
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
* Use `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tune and compare at least two different classifiers.
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)
* Deep Learning Model
