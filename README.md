## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.
To help process this data, machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset are created. The following tasks are completed: 

1. [Preprocess the raw data](#Preprocessing)
2. [Tune the models](#Tune-Model-Parameters)
3. [Compare two or more models](#Evaluate-Model-Performance)
